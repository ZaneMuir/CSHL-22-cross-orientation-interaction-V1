# Modeling cross-orientation interactions in mouse V1
LNLN model modified from [Barbera et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627321007856)

People involved: Yizhan Miao

Short Abstract:
In Barbera et al. 2022, model of V1 cell with only one subunit was used to simulate cross-orientation interactions in mouse. However, V1 neurons typically have an “on” and an “off” subunit. Here, I will build a new version of this model with "on" and "off" subunits and compare the magnitude and sensitivity of this interactions with those of the original model.

Milestones:
1. replicate the [model](https://figshare.com/articles/software/SuppFigure4_model_code_m/16755352?backTo=/collections/BarberaPriebeGlickfeld_Neuron_2022/5677225) (LNLN model) from Barbera et al. 2022 in Python.
2. modify the model with On and Off subunits and make comparisons
3. time permitting, I will add "on-off" subunits to investigate if this type of relay cell would also contribute to the cross-orientation interactions in mouse.
